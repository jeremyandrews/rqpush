# RQPush

A library to assist with pushing notifications to RQueue.

## Notifications

RQPush requires that all notifications define the following fields:

```json
{
    "app": "AppName",
    "alert_type": "type of alert",
    "lang": "Langauge code",
    "title": "Subject",
    "short_text": "Short body",
    "short_html": "<p>Short body</p>",
    "long_text": "Body",
    "long_html": "<html><p>Body</p></html>",
}
```

For example:

```json
{
    "app": "Netgrasp",
    "alert_type": "first_seen_device",
    "lang": "en",
    "title": "[netgrasp] new device: iPhone",
    "short_text": "A new device joined your network: iPhone",
    "short_html": "<p>A new device joined your network: <em>iPhone</em></p>",
    "long_text": "A new device joined your network:
     * iPhone
     * ip: 10.202.14.37 [ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]
     * previously seen: never
     * first seen: now

    In the past 24 hours this device talked to 1 device:
     * Gateway: 10.202.14.1

    "long_html": "<P><UL>
     <LI>iPhone</LI>
     <LI>ip: 10.202.14.37 [ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]</LI>
     <LI>previously seen: never</LI>
     <LI>first seen: now</LI>
    </UL>
    In the past 24 hours this device talked to 1 device:

    </UL></P>
    <DIV ID="footer">

    </DIV>",
}
```
